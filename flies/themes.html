                    <h5>Civilization vs. Savagery</h5>
<p>The central concern of <i>Lord of the Flies</i> is
the conflict between two competing impulses that exist within all
human beings: the instinct to live by rules, act peacefully, follow
moral commands, and value the good of the group against the instinct
to gratify one&rsquo;s immediate desires, act violently to obtain supremacy
over others, and enforce one&rsquo;s will. This conflict might be expressed
in a number of ways: civilization vs. savagery, order vs. chaos,
reason vs. impulse, law vs. anarchy, or the broader heading of good
vs. evil. Throughout the novel, Golding associates the instinct
of civilization with good and the instinct of savagery with evil.</p>

//--></script></div>
                    <p>The conflict between the two instincts is the driving
force of the novel, explored through the dissolution of the young
English boys&rsquo; civilized, moral, disciplined behavior as they accustom
themselves to a wild, brutal, barbaric life in the jungle. <i>Lord
of the Flies</i> is an allegorical novel, which means that
Golding conveys many of his main ideas and themes through symbolic
characters and objects. He represents the conflict between civilization
and savagery in the conflict between the novel&rsquo;s two main characters:
Ralph, the protagonist, who represents order and leadership; and
Jack, the antagonist, who represents savagery and the desire for
power.</p>
<p>As the novel progresses, Golding shows how different people
feel the influences of the instincts of civilization and savagery
to different degrees. Piggy, for instance, has no savage feelings,
while Roger seems barely capable of comprehending the rules of civilization. Generally,
however, Golding implies that the instinct of savagery is far more
primal and fundamental to the human psyche than the instinct of
civilization. Golding sees moral behavior, in many cases, as something
that civilization forces upon the individual rather than a natural
expression of human individuality. When left to their own devices,
Golding implies, people naturally revert to cruelty, savagery, and
barbarism. This idea of innate human evil is central to <i>Lord
of the Flies,</i> and finds expression in several important
symbols, most notably the beast and the sow&rsquo;s head on the stake.
Among all the characters, only Simon seems to possess anything like
a natural, innate goodness. </p>
                

                    <h5>Loss of Innocence</h5>
<p>As the boys on the island progress from well-behaved,
orderly children longing for rescue to cruel, bloodthirsty hunters
who have no desire to return to civilization, they naturally lose
the sense of innocence that they possessed at the beginning of the
novel. The painted savages in Chapter <span class="small-caps">12</span> who
have hunted, tortured, and killed animals and human beings are a
far cry from the guileless children swimming in the lagoon in Chapter <span class="small-caps">3</span>.
But Golding does not portray this loss of innocence as something
that is done to the children; rather, it results naturally from
their increasing openness to the innate evil and savagery that has
always existed within them. Golding implies that civilization can
mitigate but never wipe out the innate evil that exists within all
human beings. The forest glade in which Simon sits in Chapter <span class="small-caps">3</span> symbolizes
this loss of innocence. At first, it is a place of natural beauty
and peace, but when Simon returns later in the novel, he discovers
the bloody sow&rsquo;s head impaled upon a stake in the middle of the
clearing. The bloody offering to the beast has disrupted the paradise
that existed before&mdash;a powerful symbol of innate human evil disrupting
childhood innocence.</p>
                
            

                <h4>Motifs</h4>
<blockquote class="quotation">Motifs are recurring structures, contrasts, and literary
devices that can help to develop and inform the text&rsquo;s major themes.</blockquote>

                    <h5>Biblical Parallels</h5>
<p>Many critics have characterized <i>Lord of the Flies</i> as
a retelling of episodes from the Bible. While that description may
be an oversimplification, the novel does echo certain Christian
images and themes. Golding does not make any explicit or direct
connections to Christian symbolism in <i>Lord of the Flies</i>;
instead, these biblical parallels function as a kind of subtle motif
in the novel, adding thematic resonance to the main ideas of the
story. The island itself, particularly Simon&rsquo;s glade in the forest,
recalls the Garden of Eden in its status as an originally pristine
place that is corrupted by the introduction of evil. Similarly,
we may see the Lord of the Flies as a representation of the devil,
for it works to promote evil among humankind. Furthermore, many
critics have drawn strong parallels between Simon and Jesus. Among
the boys, Simon is the one who arrives at the moral truth of the
novel, and the other boys kill him sacrificially as a consequence
of having discovered this truth. Simon&rsquo;s conversation with the Lord
of the Flies also parallels the confrontation between Jesus and
the devil during Jesus&rsquo; forty days in the wilderness, as told in
the Christian Gospels.</p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that the parallels
between Simon and Christ are not complete, and that there are limits
to reading <i>Lord of the Flies</i> purely as a Christian
allegory. Save for Simon&rsquo;s two uncanny predictions of the future,
he lacks the supernatural connection to God that Jesus has in Christian
tradition. Although Simon is wise in many ways, his death does not
bring salvation to the island; rather, his death plunges the island
deeper into savagery and moral guilt. Moreover, Simon dies before
he is able to tell the boys the truth he has discovered. Jesus,
in contrast, was killed while spreading his moral philosophy. In
this way, Simon&mdash;and <i>Lord of the Flies</i> as a whole&mdash;echoes
Christian ideas and themes without developing explicit, precise
parallels with them. The novel&rsquo;s biblical parallels enhance its
moral themes but are not necessarily the primary key to interpreting
the story.</p>

                    <h5>The Conch Shell</h5>
<div class="floatingad"><script language="JavaScript"><!--
DisplayAds("Top,Right,x01,Middle,Middle2!Middle2");
//--></script></div>
                    <p>Ralph and Piggy discover the conch shell on the beach
at the start of the novel and use it to summon the boys together
after the crash separates them. Used in this capacity, the conch
shell becomes a powerful symbol of civilization and order in the
novel. The shell effectively governs the boys&rsquo; meetings, for the
boy who holds the shell holds the right to speak. In this regard,
the shell is more than a symbol&mdash;it is an actual vessel of political
legitimacy and democratic power. As the island civilization erodes
and the boys descend into savagery, the conch shell loses its power
and influence among them. Ralph clutches the shell desperately when
he talks about his role in murdering Simon. Later, the
other boys ignore Ralph and throw stones at him when he attempts
to blow the conch in Jack&rsquo;s camp. The boulder that Roger rolls onto
Piggy also crushes the conch shell, signifying the demise of the
civilized instinct among almost all the boys on the island.</p>
                

                    <h5>Piggy&rsquo;s Glasses</h5>
<p>Piggy is the most intelligent, rational boy in the group,
and his glasses represent the power of science and intellectual
endeavor in society. This symbolic significance is clear from the
start of the novel, when the boys use the lenses from Piggy&rsquo;s glasses
to focus the sunlight and start a fire. When Jack&rsquo;s hunters raid
Ralph&rsquo;s camp and steal the glasses, the savages effectively take
the power to make fire, leaving Ralph&rsquo;s group helpless.</p>
                

                    <h5>The Signal Fire</h5>
<p>The signal fire burns on the mountain, and later on the
beach, to attract the notice of passing ships that might be able
to rescue the boys. As a result, the signal fire becomes a barometer
of the boys&rsquo; connection to civilization. In the early parts of the
novel, the fact that the boys maintain the fire is a sign that they
want to be rescued and return to society. When the fire burns low
or goes out, we realize that the boys have lost sight of their desire
to be rescued and have accepted their savage lives on the island.
The signal fire thus functions as a kind of measurement of the strength
of the civilized instinct remaining on the island. Ironically, at
the end of the novel, a fire finally summons a ship to the island,
but not the signal fire. Instead, it is the fire of savagery&mdash;the
forest fire Jack&rsquo;s gang starts as part of his quest to hunt and
kill Ralph.</p>
                

                    <h5>The Beast</h5>
<p>The imaginary beast that frightens all the boys stands
for the primal instinct of savagery that exists within all human
beings. The boys are afraid of the beast, but only Simon reaches
the realization that they fear the beast because it exists within
each of them. As the boys grow more savage, their belief
in the beast grows stronger. By the end of the novel, the boys are
leaving it sacrifices and treating it as a totemic god. The boys&rsquo;
behavior is what brings the beast into existence, so the more savagely
the boys act, the more real the beast seems to become.</p>
                

                    <h5>The Lord of the Flies</h5>
<p>The Lord of the Flies is the bloody, severed sow&rsquo;s head
that Jack impales on a stake in the forest glade as an offering
to the beast. This complicated symbol becomes the most important
image in the novel when Simon confronts the sow&rsquo;s head in the glade
and it seems to speak to him, telling him that evil lies within
every human heart and promising to have some &ldquo;fun&rdquo; with him. (This
&ldquo;fun&rdquo; foreshadows Simon&rsquo;s death in the following chapter.) In this
way, the Lord of the Flies becomes both a physical manifestation
of the beast, a symbol of the power of evil, and a kind of Satan
figure who evokes the beast within each human being. Looking at
the novel in the context of biblical parallels, the Lord of the
Flies recalls the devil, just as Simon recalls Jesus. In fact, the
name &ldquo;Lord of the Flies&rdquo; is a literal translation of the name of
the biblical name Beelzebub, a powerful demon in hell sometimes
thought to be the devil himself.</p>
                

                    <h5>Ralph, Piggy, Jack, Simon, and Roger</h5>
<p>
                        <i>Lord of the Flies</i> is an allegorical novel,
and many of its characters signify important ideas or themes. Ralph
represents order, leadership, and civilization. Piggy represents
the scientific and intellectual aspects of civilization. Jack represents
unbridled savagery and the desire for power. Simon represents natural
human goodness. Roger represents brutality and bloodlust at their
most extreme. To the extent that the boys&rsquo; society resembles a political
state, the littluns might be seen as the common people, while the
older boys represent the ruling classes and political leaders. The
relationships that develop between the older boys and the younger
ones emphasize the older boys&rsquo; connection to either the civilized
or the savage instinct: civilized boys like Ralph and Simon use
their power to protect the younger boys and advance the good of
the group; savage boys like Jack and Roger use their power to gratify
their own desires, treating the littler boys as objects for their
own amusement.</p>
