<p><b class="small-caps">narrator </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;The story is told by an anonymous third-person narrator
who conveys the events of the novel without commenting on the action
or intruding into the story.</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">point of view </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;The narrator speaks in the third person, primarily
focusing on Ralph&rsquo;s point of view but following Jack and Simon in
certain episodes. The narrator is omniscient and gives us access

<p><b class="small-caps">tone </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Dark; violent; pessimistic; tragic; unsparing</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">tense </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Immediate past</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">setting (time) </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Near future</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">setting (place) </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;A deserted tropical island</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">protagonist </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Ralph</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">major conflict</b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Free from the rules that adult society formerly imposed
on them, the boys marooned on the island struggle with the conflicting human
instincts that exist within each of them&mdash;the instinct to work toward
civilization and order and the instinct to descend into savagery,
violence, and chaos.</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">rising action</b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;The boys assemble on the beach. In the election for
leader, Ralph defeats Jack, who is furious when he loses. As the
boys explore the island, tension grows between Jack, who is interested
only in hunting, and Ralph, who believes most of the boys&rsquo; efforts should
go toward building shelters and maintaining a signal fire. When
rumors surface that there is some sort of beast living on the island,
the boys grow fearful, and the group begins to divide into two camps
supporting Ralph and Jack, respectively. Ultimately, Jack forms
a new tribe altogether, fully immersing himself in the savagery
of the hunt.</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">climax </b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Simon encounters the Lord of the Flies in the forest
glade and realizes that the beast is not a physical entity but rather something
that exists within each boy on the island. When Simon tries to approach
the other boys and convey this message to them, they fall on him
and kill him savagely.</p>
<p><b class="small-caps">falling action</b>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Virtually all the boys on the island abandon Ralph and
Piggy and descend further into savagery and chaos. When the other
boys kill Piggy and destroy the conch shell, Ralph flees from Jack&rsquo;s tribe
and encounters the naval officer on the beach.</p>

Chapter <span class="small-caps">6</span> foreshadows Piggy&rsquo;s death; the
Lord of the Flies&rsquo;s promise to have some &ldquo;fun&rdquo; with Simon foreshadows
