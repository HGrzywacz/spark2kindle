                <a name="Ralph"></a>
                <a name="1"></a>
                <h4>Ralph</h4>
<p>Ralph is the athletic, charismatic protagonist of <i>Lord
of the Flies.</i> Elected the leader of the boys at the beginning
of the novel, Ralph is the primary representative of order, civilization,
and productive leadership in the novel. While most of the other
boys initially are concerned with playing, having fun, and avoiding
work, Ralph sets about building huts and thinking of ways to maximize
their chances of being rescued. For this reason, Ralph&rsquo;s power and
influence over the other boys are secure at the beginning of the
novel. However, as the group gradually succumbs to savage instincts
over the course of the novel, Ralph&rsquo;s position declines precipitously
while Jack&rsquo;s rises. Eventually, most of the boys except Piggy leave
Ralph&rsquo;s group for Jack&rsquo;s, and Ralph is left alone to be hunted by
Jack&rsquo;s tribe. Ralph&rsquo;s commitment to civilization and morality is
strong, and his main wish is to be rescued and returned to the society
of adults. In a sense, this strength gives Ralph a moral victory
at the end of the novel, when he casts the Lord of the Flies to
the ground and takes up the stake it is impaled on to defend himself
against Jack&rsquo;s hunters.</p>

                <p>In the earlier parts of the novel, Ralph is unable to
understand why the other boys would give in to base instincts of
bloodlust and barbarism. The sight of the hunters chanting and dancing
is baffling and distasteful to him. As the novel progresses, however,
Ralph, like Simon, comes to understand that savagery exists within
all the boys. Ralph remains determined not to let this savagery
-overwhelm him, and only briefly does he consider joining Jack&rsquo;s
tribe in order to save himself. When Ralph hunts a boar for the
first time, however, he experiences the exhilaration and thrill
of bloodlust and violence. When he attends Jack&rsquo;s feast, he is swept
away by the frenzy, dances on the edge of the group, and participates
in the killing of Simon. This firsthand knowledge of the evil that
exists within him, as within all human beings, is tragic for Ralph,
and it plunges him into listless despair for a time. But this knowledge
also enables him to cast down the Lord of the Flies at the end of
the novel. Ralph&rsquo;s story ends semi-tragically: although he is rescued
and returned to civilization, when he sees the naval officer, he
weeps with the burden of his new knowledge about the human capacity
for evil.</p>

<div class="content_txt">
                <a name="Jack"></a>
                <a name="2"></a>
                <h4>Jack</h4>
<p>The strong-willed, egomaniacal Jack is the novel&rsquo;s primary
representative of the instinct of savagery, violence, and the desire
for power&mdash;in short, the antithesis of Ralph. From the beginning
of the novel, Jack desires power above all other things. He is furious
when he loses the election to Ralph and continually pushes the boundaries of
his subordinate role in the group. Early on, Jack retains the sense of
moral propriety and behavior that society instilled in him&mdash;in fact,
in school, he was the leader of the choirboys. The first time he encounters
a pig, he is unable to kill it. But Jack soon becomes obsessed with
hunting and devotes himself to the task, painting his face like
a barbarian and giving himself over to bloodlust. The more savage
Jack becomes, the more he is able to control the rest of the group.
Indeed, apart from Ralph, Simon, and Piggy, the group largely follows
Jack in casting off moral restraint and embracing violence and savagery.
Jack&rsquo;s love of authority and violence are intimately connected,
as both enable him to feel powerful and exalted. By the end of the
novel, Jack has learned to use the boys&rsquo; fear of the beast to control
their behavior&mdash;a reminder of how religion and superstition can be
manipulated as instruments of power. </p>

<div class="content_txt">
                <a name="Simon"></a>
                <a name="3"></a>
                <h4>Simon</h4>
<p>Whereas Ralph and Jack stand at opposite ends of the spectrum between
civilization and savagery, Simon stands on an entirely different
plane from all the other boys. Simon embodies a kind of innate,
spiritual human goodness that is deeply connected with nature and,
in its own way, as primal as Jack&rsquo;s evil. The other boys abandon
moral behavior as soon as civilization is no longer there to impose
it upon them. They are not <i>innately</i> moral; rather,
the adult world&mdash;the threat of punishment for misdeeds&mdash;has conditioned them
to act morally. To an extent, even the seemingly civilized Ralph and
Piggy are products of social conditioning, as we see when they participate
in the hunt-dance. In Golding&rsquo;s view, the human impulse toward civilization
is not as deeply rooted as the human impulse toward savagery. Unlike
all the other boys on the island, Simon acts morally not out of
guilt or shame but because he believes in the inherent value of
morality. He behaves kindly toward the younger children, and he
is the first to realize the problem posed by the beast and the Lord
of the Flies&mdash;that is, that the monster on the island is not a real,
physical beast but rather a savagery that lurks within each human
being. The sow&rsquo;s head on the stake symbolizes this idea,
as we see in Simon&rsquo;s vision of the head speaking to him. Ultimately,
this idea of the inherent evil within each human being stands as
the moral conclusion and central problem of the novel. Against this
idea of evil, Simon represents a contrary idea of essential human
goodness. However, his brutal murder at the hands of the other boys
indicates the scarcity of that good amid an overwhelming abundance
of evil.</p>
