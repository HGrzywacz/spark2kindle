gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them. Yet there
was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which
he dare not throw. Here, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of
the old life. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents
and school and policemen and the law.<br>

<div class="explanationtext" id="explanation1" style="display:none;">
                    <p>This passage from Chapter <span class="small-caps">4</span> describes
the beginnings of Roger&rsquo;s cruelty to the littluns, an important
early step in the group&rsquo;s decline into savagery. At this point in
the novel, the boys are still building their civilization, and the
civilized instinct still dominates the savage instinct. The cracks
are beginning to show, however, particularly in the willingness
of some of the older boys to use physical force and violence to
give themselves a sense of superiority over the smaller boys. This
quotation shows us the psychological workings behind the beginnings
of that willingness. Roger feels the urge to torment Henry, the
littlun, by pelting him with stones, but the vestiges of socially
imposed standards of behavior are still too strong for him to give
in completely to his savage urges. At this point, Roger still feels constrained
by &ldquo;parents and school and policemen and the law&rdquo;&mdash;the figures and
institutions that enforce society&rsquo;s moral code. Before long, Roger
and most of the other boys lose their respect for these forces,
and violence, torture, and murder break out as the savage instinct
replaces the instinct for civilization among the group.</p>

mind was crowded with memories; memories of the knowledge that had
come to them when they closed in on the struggling pig, knowledge
that they had outwitted a living thing, imposed their will upon
it, taken away its life like a long satisfying drink.<br>

<div class="explanationtext" id="explanation2" style="display:none;">
                    <p>This quotation, also from Chapter <span class="small-caps">4</span>,
explores Jack&rsquo;s mental state in the aftermath of killing his first
pig, another milestone in the boys&rsquo; decline into savage behavior.
Jack exults in the kill and is unable to think about anything else
because his mind is &ldquo;crowded with memories&rdquo; of the hunt. Golding
explicitly connects Jack&rsquo;s exhilaration with the feelings of power
and superiority he experienced in killing the pig. Jack&rsquo;s excitement
stems not from pride at having found food and helped the group but
from having &ldquo;outwitted&rdquo; another creature and &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; his will
upon it. Earlier in the novel, Jack claims that hunting is important
to provide meat for the group; now, it becomes clear that Jack&rsquo;s
obsession with hunting is due to the satisfaction it provides his
primal instincts and has nothing to do with contributing to the
common good.</p>

<div class="explanationtext" id="explanation3" style="display:none;">
                    <p>Simon speaks these words in Chapter <span class="small-caps">5</span>,
during the meeting in which the boys consider the question of the
beast. One littlun has proposed the terrifying idea that the beast
may hide in the ocean during the day and emerge only at night, and
the boys argue about whether the beast might actually exist. Simon,
meanwhile, proposes that perhaps the beast is only the boys themselves.
Although the other boys laugh off Simon&rsquo;s suggestion, Simon&rsquo;s words
are central to Golding&rsquo;s point that innate human evil exists. Simon
is the first character in the novel to see the beast not as an external
force but as a component of human nature. Simon does not yet fully
understand his own idea, but it becomes clearer to him in Chapter <span class="small-caps">8</span>,
when he has a vision in the glade and confronts the Lord of the
Flies.</p>

isn&rsquo;t anyone to help you. Only me. And I&rsquo;m the Beast. . . . Fancy
thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill! . . .
You knew, didn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m part of you? Close, close, close! I&rsquo;m
the reason why it&rsquo;s no go? Why things are the way they are?&rdquo;<br>

<div class="explanationtext" id="explanation4" style="display:none;">
                    <p>The Lord of the Flies speaks these lines
to Simon in Chapter <span class="small-caps">8</span>, during Simon&rsquo;s vision
in the glade. These words confirm Simon&rsquo;s speculation in Chapter <span class="small-caps">5</span> that
perhaps the beast is only the boys themselves. This idea of the
evil on the island being within the boys is central to the novel&rsquo;s
exploration of innate human savagery. The Lord of the Flies identifies
itself as the beast and acknowledges to Simon that it exists within
all human beings: &ldquo;You knew, didn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m part of you?&rdquo; The creature&rsquo;s
grotesque language and bizarre appropriation of the boys&rsquo; slang
(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the reason why it&rsquo;s no go&rdquo;) makes the creature appear even
more hideous and devilish, for he taunts Simon with the same colloquial,
familiar language the boys use themselves. Simon, startled by his
discovery, tries to convey it to the rest of the boys, but the evil
and savagery within them boils to the surface, as they mistake him
for the beast itself, set upon him, and kill him.</p>

wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man&rsquo;s heart, and
the fall through the air of a true, wise friend called Piggy.<br>

<div class="explanationtext" id="explanation5" style="display:none;">
                    <p>These lines from the end of Chapter <span class="small-caps">12</span> occur
near the close of the novel, after the boys encounter the naval
officer, who appears as if out of nowhere to save them. When Ralph
sees the officer, his sudden realization that he is safe and will
be returned to civilization plunges him into a reflective despair.
The rescue is not a moment of unequivocal joy, for Ralph realizes
that, although he is saved from death on the island, he will never
be the same. He has lost his innocence and learned about the evil
that lurks within all human beings. Here, Golding explicitly connects
the sources of Ralph&rsquo;s despair to two of the main themes of the
novel: the end of innocence and the &ldquo;darkness of man&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; the
presence of savage instincts lurking within all human beings, even
at the height of civilization.</p>
